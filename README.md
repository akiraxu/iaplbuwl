Running the Program

-cd into the same directory that this readme is located in

-ls command should show this output

  -iaplbuwl
  
  -SimulationResults
  
  -README.md
  
-compile the java code by running: javac iaplbuwl/MySimulation.java

-run the code by inputting: java iaplbuwl/MySimulation


Expected Run Time

-Due to the amount of data being generated our program takes anywhere between 5 to 10 minutes to complete


Output

-The data will be outputted to .csv files located in the same directory as the readme

-The data for the first scenario where no load balancing occurs will be written to the naive.csv file

-The data for the second scenario where balancing based on rssi will be written to the paper.csv file

-The data for the third scenario where balancing is based on rssi and access point load

 will be written to the ours.csv file


 Results

-The results will change each time the program is run because there are areas where we introduced randomness

 in the folder SimulationResults you will see the datasets that we used to create the graphs and diagrams used in our report
